## Overview  
The **Lazy-Regresser** project is designed to compare the accuracy of different regression models in predicting the melting point of protein sequences based on their molecular weight and amino acid composition features. The goal is to identify the best-performing models for this specific task, leveraging various machine learning techniques with a focus on ease of use and minimal manual tuning (hence the "lazy" approach).
Used SVR, Random Forest and Linear Regression techniques of the module of Lazy Regression. Can be used other libraries by just calling them.

## Features
- **Multiple Regression Models**: Includes a variety of regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
- **Automated Workflow**: Simplifies model training, evaluation, and comparison by automating key steps.
- **Customizable Input**: Accepts molecular weight and amino acid composition data of protein sequences as inputs.
- **Performance Comparison**: Provides a detailed comparison of model accuracy, enabling users to identify the best models for predicting protein melting points.
- **Lazy Tuning**: Uses simple tuning strategies to optimize models without requiring deep expertise in model hyperparameters.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Lazy-Regresser_for_Comparison_of_Accuracy_of_Melting-Point_of_Protein-Sequences.git
   cd Lazy-Regresser_for_Comparison_of_Accuracy_of_Melting-Point_of_Protein-Sequences
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) If using Jupyter notebooks, start Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Data Preparation
Ensure you have a dataset containing protein sequences, molecular weight, amino acid composition, and their corresponding melting points. Place this dataset in the `data/` folder.

### 2. Model Training
Run the training script to fit multiple regression models to the data:
   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```

### 3. Model Evaluation
Use the evaluation script to compare the performance of the trained models:
   ```bash
   python src/evaluate.py
   ```

This will generate a report on the accuracy of each model in predicting the melting points.

### 4. Customization
You can modify the list of models or tweak the parameters in the `train.py` file to experiment with different algorithms or settings.

## Results
The evaluation metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R², will be stored in the `results/` folder, along with comparison plots visualizing the accuracy of each model.
